# Pipeline Configuration for Wiki & Yahoo Finance Scraper
#
# This YAML file defines the pipeline for scraping S&P 500 symbols from Wikipedia,
# fetching their financial data from Yahoo Finance, and uploading the results to
# a Postgres database. The pipeline is composed of three main worker types and
# two queues for data flow management:
#
# Queues:
#   - SymbolQueue: Holds symbols extracted from Wikipedia to be processed by YahooFinanceWorker.
#   - PostgresUploading: Holds processed financial data ready for upload to Postgres.
#
# Workers:
#   - WikiWorker: Scrapes the list of S&P 500 symbols from Wikipedia and pushes them to SymbolQueue.
#   - YahooFinanceWorker: Consumes symbols from SymbolQueue, scrapes financial data from Yahoo Finance,
#     and pushes the results to PostgresUploading. Multiple instances can run in parallel.
#   - PostgresWorker: Consumes data from PostgresUploading and uploads it to a Postgres database.
#     Multiple instances can run in parallel for higher throughput.
#
# Each worker is defined with its class, location, instance count, and input/output queues.
# This configuration enables scalable, parallel processing of financial data scraping and storage.
